Hello World!

My name is Nicholas Quillin. I am an honors aerospace engineering student, rocketeer and hacker. This is my blog, a space where I can go into detail about all my projects and a place that I will be sharing some of my thoughts with the world.

Right now I am particularly interested in propulsion, sustainability and accessability, and the things I write will hopefully reflect that.

Here are a few of my handles if you would like to contact me!
