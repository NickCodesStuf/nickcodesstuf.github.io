## About Me

Hi I am Nick!

I am an Aerospace Engineering student driven to develop innovative solutions to make the world a more sustainable and accessible place. At the University of Texas at Arlington, I’m focused on deepening my technical abilities to address these global issues; however, I am also currently looking for internship opportunities to give me an outlet to put these skills to practice.  
  
What makes me stand out is my drive to continually improve. As such I am continuously looking to challenge myself through new hands-on experiences. Recently I have been working on projects like AlphaGuard, the first real-time, AI powered anti-scam which I demoed at HackUNT, and NurseAI, a cheap wearable healthcare assistant I demoed at HackUTA. I am also currently leading an investigation on simplex injectors and am involved with solving real-world engineering problems at MavsRacing and AeroMavs I am excited to soon be able to share!
