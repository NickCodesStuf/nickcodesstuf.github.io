## Background
It is common notion that space is an esotaric field. Most people do not understand why we do the things we do or the point of exploring. I would like to change that by explaining the reason why we continue to explore space

## Science
A common misconception is that science is or is nearly complete. This perception probably stems from the poor understanding people have about the nature of science and what we do. For instance we do not yet understand the nature of space and time nor how we got here and what is out there.

A common argument is "trust the science" which is a ridiculous thing to do. Science is a process of meticulous refinement of our understanding through the repeated process of conjecture and disproval.
