Many believe space exploration is esoteric field, which is quite the shame. Due to lack of public support, funding for spaceflight has gradually been on the decline for a while now.

Nasa Budget

Furthermore, with the meteoric rise of private launch providers like spaceX and blue Origin, some people are even beginning to believe these companies should replace Nasa altogether. In my opinion not only is this argument flawed, but in some part our overreliance on the private sector has already jeopardized the Artemis mission and endangered our commanding lead in outer space (which is a discussion for another day). Nevertheless, one way or another, I believe that space is being devalued. Many of us got into spaceflight because it is awesome and the tendency to want to explore the unknown.  However this is not the only reason to go to space, and if we do not convince the public otherwise not only will we all be out of a job, but also we will be doing an gross disservice to future generations.
## Science
A common misconception is that science is or is nearly complete. This idea is nothing new either.

These days many people still mistake science for truth. The oxymoron "trust the science" has become equally a means of addressing pseudoscience and shutting down critical thinking alike.  In reality we do not know if modern science is in fact the truth, but rather we have simply been yet to disprove it. There is no such thing as a theory of everything and we have no clue how close or how far we are from understanding this world. 

As such there is untold value in the pursuit of science. While this meticulous process is slow and the endeavor is practically never particularly profitable in the short term, over the long term scientific progress has compounded well beyond every other investment civilization has made. This is not merely conjecture, but was recently explained by Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion, and Peter Howitt, which earned them the 2025 Prize in Economics. While I am not particularly knowledgeable about this, subject I strongly recommend reading the accompanying [public release](https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2025/10/popular-economicsciences2025-3.pdf) for those interested.

So while it is true that because of Nasa we have GPS, fly-by-wire, and so many other critical technologies, continued investment into scientific work and spaceflight today is needed if we wish to reap the compounding rewards in the future. As soon as we loose the technical know-how and experience, it cannot be regained without a costly retooling process.
## Soft Power
Besides  technology is a incredible soft power. While nowadays, spaceflight is getting more and more commonplace, space missions still carry a large level of prestige and is regarded by many as the epitamy of modern science.
## Resources

## Danger
Another reason to explore space is

>The universe is a violent place, Stars engulf planets , Supernova fire lethal rays across space, asteroids hurtle around at hundreds of miles a second. Granted these phenomena do not make space sound very inviting. Yet these are reasons why we should venture out into space, instead of staying put; because, if we wait long enough, they will reach us here.
